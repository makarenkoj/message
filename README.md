Test task Message
===

Build a web application which creates a text self-destructing messages. 

Flow: 

* 1.User posts message to the REST API endpoint 

* 2.App generates a link and returns it as a response 

* 3.User can do request to the provided link and see saved message only once 4. On second request info message “You already requested this message” should be returned 

* Cover your application with the unit tests using rspec. 

* Push the code to Bitbucket or Github. 

* Deploy your application to Heroku. 

* Provide links to the codebase and app. 

Bonus points for implementing: 
---

* 1. Messages stored on the server side should be encrypted using AES algorithm (you can use any library for text encryption) 

* 2. Messages should be encrypted on frontend side using password and should be sent to backend in encrypted format (to view message user should enter a right password) 

Please pay attention to the best practices for REST API design, error handling and status codes.
